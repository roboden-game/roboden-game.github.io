      <h4>2. Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h4>

      <p>
        This Application does not automatically collect, share nor retain any information.
      </p>

      <p>
        If user decides to publish their highscores, this data will be sent to the server and may become part of the public leaderboard. The leaderboard entry includes this information: username (as specified by the user), their score and completion time.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's impossible to delete a leaderboard entry when it's published since we don't know who it belongs to. There is no registration or authorization, so anyone can send any data associated with username. This abstract username should not be treated as reliable identifier.
